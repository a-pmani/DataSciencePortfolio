Description:
Housing Pricing Analysis using Advanced Regression is a sophisticated 
approach employed in the real estate industry to predict housing prices 
  with high accuracy and precision. Leveraging advanced regression techniques,
  this analysis integrates various factors influencing housing prices, 
  including property characteristics, location attributes, 
economic indicators, and market trends, to provide valuable 
  insights for buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals.
Model Selection: Various advanced regression models are considered, including but not limited to:

Multiple Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
ElasticNet Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Neural Network Regression
Model selection involves evaluating the performance of each 
  model using appropriate metrics 
  (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error) 
  and selecting the one that provides the best balance between accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.
