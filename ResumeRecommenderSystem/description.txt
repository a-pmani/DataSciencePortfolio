Finding a suitable candidate for an open role could be an unnerving task, especially when there is a pool of resumes to choose from.
  It can slow down the process of getting the right candidate at the right time. An automated “Resume Recommendation Engine” could ease the tedious process of fair screening,
shortlisting resumes and be very effective in saving cost and time associated with it. This engine could work with a large number of resumes by identifying the key skills and, 
  then ranking the candidates based on their matched skills. It is also capable of finding the most relevant resume to the job description based on cosine similarities
