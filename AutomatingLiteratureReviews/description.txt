The literature review is a vital part of developing a research idea. Due to the availability of large amounts of scientific publications in 
  the digital media, this can be a complex and time-consuming process. An important part of the process is identifying relevant publications, 
this usually involves researchers spending a lot of time carefully going through scientific literature and understanding if the publication is 
  relevant to their research area. This can be automated and expedited using natural language processing and recommendation systems.

Dataset:
The data we are planning to use for this project is a subset of the arXiv Dataset from Cornell University. 
  Quoted from the website, arXiv is a free distribution service and an open-access archive for scholarly articles in 
  the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, 
statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics.  The dataset is also hosted in Kaggle.
